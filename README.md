BeerJS Helsinki is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around JavaScript, but in reality the scope is pretty open. We start the meetup by just hanging out and chatting then we will get into presentations. Anyone can present for any amount of time.

So if you are a javascript maniac or just curious, come and have a chat with us!

### Want to hang out?

We usually meet every Tuesday in a bar choosen from the community. Do not be shy and come and talk to us on so many topics.

### Want to share something?

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.

Also feel free to come with problems and questions about your code, my code, or whatever.

Comment on the current meetings issue to formally request time or a topic.


### Want to drink beer?

Of course you do. :beer: is the fuel of the community, but remember: drinking beer is __not required__ to participate though.
